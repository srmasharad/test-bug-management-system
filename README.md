## System Design

### Bug Lifecycle

The system implements a complete bug lifecycle with the following 10 states:

1. **New** - Bug reported but not reviewed
2. **Assigned** - Bug assigned to developer/tester
3. **Open** - Bug acknowledged, work in progress
4. **Fixed** - Bug fix implemented, awaiting verification
5. **Retest** - Bug fix being retested by QA
6. **Verified** - Bug fix confirmed working
7. **Closed** - Bug resolved and closed
8. **Reopened** - Bug reappeared or fix insufficient
9. **Rejected** - Bug not valid or will not be fixed
10. **Deferred** - Bug fix postponed to future release

**Workflow:** New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Verified → Closed

### Bug Taxonomy

**By Severity:**
- Critical: System crash, data loss, security vulnerability
- High: Major functionality broken, no workaround
- Medium: Functionality impaired, workaround available
- Low: Minor issue, cosmetic defect

**By Priority:**
- P1 (Urgent): Must fix immediately, blocking release
- P2 (High): Fix before release
- P3 (Medium): Fix if time permits
- P4 (Low): Fix in future release

**By Type:**
Functional, Performance, UI/UX, Security, Compatibility, Data, Integration

### Database Design

**Conceptual ERD:**
The system uses 7 main entities:
- Projects (with sub-projects)
- Testers
- Test Suites
- Test Cases
- Test Executions
- Bugs

**Logical ERD (3rd Normal Form):**
All tables are normalized to 3NF with proper primary/foreign key relationships:
- No partial dependencies
- No transitive dependencies
- Atomic values in all columns

**Database Tables:**

1. **projects**: project_id (PK), name, description, start_date, end_date, status
2. **sub_projects**: sub_project_id (PK), project_id (FK), name, description
3. **testers**: tester_id (PK), name, email, role, date_joined
4. **test_suites**: test_suite_id (PK), project_id (FK), name, description, created_date
5. **test_cases**: test_case_id (PK), test_suite_id (FK), name, description, preconditions, steps, expected_result, priority, created_date
6. **test_executions**: execution_id (PK), test_case_id (FK), tester_id (FK), execution_date, status, notes
7. **bugs**: bug_id (PK), project_id (FK), sub_project_id (FK), test_case_id (FK), discovered_by (FK), assigned_to (FK), name, description, steps_to_reproduce, status, severity, priority, type, discovered_date, assigned_date, resolution_date, environment

Detailed database design documentation is available in [docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](./docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md).

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically seed the database with test data.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Environment Configuration

**Backend (.env):**
```
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=test_management
```

**Frontend (.env):**
```
